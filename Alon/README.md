Instructions:
    1. cd to sources directory
    2. compile project using make command
    3. cd to Compiled Directory
    3. run ./Compiled/Launcher.out -c <Decrypter count> -l <string length> [-t <timeout>] [-n <rounds>]
    4. give 100 ;)

P.S
   there is a known tini tiny itsy bitsy problem with process syncronization when using small number of decrypters (proven to happen with 1 decryptor).
   you can either ignore or ignore :)
